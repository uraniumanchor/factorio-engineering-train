receiver:

- arithemetic combinator
  - input from receiver chests and tanks, multiplied by -1
  - output to filter inserters, pumps, and train station
- constant combinator
  - outputs desired item amounts to same output network as arithmetic combinator
- receiver chests
  - 6n, where n is number of cargo wagons
  - storage, hooked to receiver tanks and arithmetic input
- receiver inserters
  - 6n, where n is number of cargo wagons
  - inputs from pumps and output of combinators
- receiver tanks
  - 2n, where n is number of fluids
  - hooked to receiver chests and arithmetic input
- receiver pump
  - hooked to receiver inserters and combinator output
  - activates when (liquid) is greater than (n) (-15k)
- roboport
  - read robot statistics
  - outputs to two inserters
- roboport inserters
  - reads construction robots in roboport, less than (n) (50)
  - reads logistics robots in roboport, less than (n) (50)
- signals
  - at end of rail opposite station, 7n+1 where n is total number of train sections
  - one past station if single ended train
- rails
  - 3.5n, where n is cars + locomotives
  - one additional if single ended train
- station
  - enabled when anything is > 0
  - hooked to combinator output

sender:

- red inserters (4) or blue inserters (2)
- requesters, one for each unique item type
- signals
  - at end of rail opposite station, 7n+1 where n is total number of train sections
  - one past station if single ended train
- rails
  - 3.5n, where n is cars + locomotives
  - one additional if single ended train
- station
  - nothing special
- trains
  - locked slots
  - schedule
